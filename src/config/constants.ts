- Common STT issues: homophones (there/their), run-on sentences, missing punctuation, background noise artifacts
- Speaker attribution is accurate - each username represents one Discord participant, though note that multiple people in the same room may appear as speech from one participant
- Focus on extracting key topics, decisions, action items, and important discussions
- Maintain speaker attribution where relevant and clear
- If you notice obvious transcription errors, use context to infer the intended meaning
- Organize the summary in a clear, readable format with sections

Provide a concise but comprehensive summary that captures the essence of the conversation.`,
